### Background

Golang has really become my go to language, and has replaced Python as my main scripting language.  I love how easy it is to write. I love haw fast it is to compile, and is a compiled language, so I can just distribute a single binary instead of hoping that there is a Python run-time install (I.E. small container images).  And with distributing these binaries, I can easily cross compile Golang to different architectures, and OS's without installing a cumbersome tool-chain.

One big downside to the Go language is that it has very little GUI support, and really doesn't come with default support what so ever.  Well there are a couple pretty good 3rd party GUI libs such as [Go-GTK][gogtk], [Go-UI][goui], and finally [Go-QML][goqml].

### About QML

I have played with QML and Qt Widgets with C++ in the past, and really enjoyed it.  QML especially is nice.  Instead of the classic XML style syntax that you find in WPF or even Qt Widgets UI files, QML uses a more JavaScript/JSON like syntax.  While I did just say JSON, it uses object like syntax instead of a string like syntax (meaning you won't have a bunch of double quotes).

Also QML can embed JavaScript directly inline or in a separate .js file to manipulate actions on the UI. Love or hate JavaScript, it is the MOST used language in the world.  The great part about this implantation is that, on the newer versions of Qt/QML, it doesn't run a whole implantation of Chromium in the background, os less overhead as compared to Electron and NW.js.

Combine that with the speed and power of the Go language, and you can create fast GUI applications easily for a lot of architectures and OS's.

### Getting Started

To start understand I am using [Arch Linux][arch], and all the packages I install through the system package manager will be for that system.  All the system packages will be for Go-QML, with the exception is for clipboard go lib, on Linux you will need either xclip or xsel.

```
// Ubuntu (based), Debian
# apt-get install xclip

// Cent-OS, RHEL
# yum install xclip

// Fedora
# dnf install xclip

// OpenSUSE, SEL
# zypper in xclip

// Arch Linux
# pacman -S xclip
```

To use Go-QML and all the QML imports in this project, install:

```
# pacman -S qt5-{base,declarative,quickcontrol}
```

_OK, so that command may look a little weird.  Using curly braces in your bash shell is a VERY powerful thing. Basically the command above is equivalent to:_

```
# pacman -S qt5-base qt5-declarative qt5-quickcontrol
```

_Also note that there is no spaces in the curly brackets, that is very important.  You can use that type of syntax when cp files or many other things_

Now that we have the system packages installed now we need to make sure you have the Go language installed and _$GOPATH_ set.  For more info on that go to [golang.org][golang], for more information.

Now that everything is set let's install the 3rd party Golang packages:

```
$ go get -u -v gopkg.in/qml.v1
```

_Any errors that pop up while installing this package means you need to install more dependencies in your system.  See the Go-QML README for more info._

Now we will install the markdown parser:

```
$ go get -u -v github.com/russross/blackfriday
```

_This tutorial will use the basic settings of what you can do with _blackfriday_.  For production use, you may want to sanitize the markdown.  All of that is covered in the _blackfriday_ README._

Finally we need to install the clipboard support:

```
$ go get -u -v github.com/atotto/clipboard
```

### References

I used a couple references in figuring out how to write this program.

- First is the _blackfriday_ REAME: [https://github.com/russross/blackfriday](https://github.com/russross/blackfriday)
- Next the _clipboard_ README: [https://github.com/atotto/clipboard](https://github.com/atotto/clipboard)
- The _GO-QML_ README: [https://github.com/go-qml/qml](https://github.com/go-qml/qml)
- The _GO-QML_ GoDoc (One of the best written GoDocs I have used): [https://godoc.org/gopkg.in/qml.v1](https://godoc.org/gopkg.in/qml.v1)
- Finally a simple _GO-QML_ Tutorial, which the most important part is at the bottom of the tut, and we will reference next: [https://golog.co/blog/article/Using_Go_with_QML_part_1](https://golog.co/blog/article/Using_Go_with_QML_part_1)

### Golang version issues

At the time of writing I am using the most recent version of the Go language (1.6.2).  Changes in cgo in 1.6 has made it so _GO-QML_ won't compile when communicating back to Go.  The work around referenced in the the tut I referenced at the end of the last section says to:

```
$ GODEBUG=cgocheck=0 go run main.go
```

So every time you run your program run it with those vars set.  _I do not recommend exporting those vars and making them global, because they may put other go programs at risk of possible security issues and errors._

You shouldn't have this issue with Go language version =< 1.5.x

### Making your directories

Let's go to your _$GOPATH/src_ dir, and create your directories. _Note: I prefer to have my GUI files in their own sub-dir in the project no matter how small the project is._

```
$ cd $GOPATH/src && mkdir -p qml-md/assets && cd qml-md && touch main.go assets/main.qml
```

This will create all the needed dir tree and needed files

Finally we can open up your favorite text editor and write some code!

### To the CODE

``` Go

// main.go

package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"

    "github.com/atotto/clipboard"
    "github.com/russross/blackfriday"
    "gopkg.in/qml.v1"
)

func main() {}
```

Here you can see we've imported the 3 3rd party libs, the _os_, and the _fmt_ libs from the _std_.

Now we will get the QML file to load in the go app

``` Go
//main.go

...

func run() error {
    engine := qml.NewEngine() //Create the QML engine
    engine.On("quit", func() { os.Exit(0) }) //If quit is called from QML the Golang program to gracefully quit

    component, err := engine.LoadFile("assets/main.qml") //Load the QML file
    if err != nil {
        return err //if you cannot load the QML file return an error
    }

    win := component.CreateWindow(nil) //Create the window
    win.Show() //Show the window
    win.Wait() //Hold the window open

    return nil //Once the window is closed return no error
}

func main() {
    if err := qml.Run(run); err != nil { //Run the QML package
        fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "ERR: %v\n", err) //Output the error in your system's stderr
        os.Exit(1) //Exit with a non-zero status
    }
}
```

Here we create a run function that returns an error.  Inside the run func we create a QML engine, and Listen for a "quit" signal to gracefully quit.<br /> Load the QML file.  And finally create, open, and hold the QML window open.

In the main function we Run the run function to initiate the QML window.

``` JavaScript
//assets/main.qml

import QtQuick 2.3 //Needed to import all base QML entities
import QtQuick.Controls 1.4 //Needed for ApplicationWindow and TextArea
import QtQuick.Layouts 1.0 //For the RowLayout

ApplicationWindow { //The base entity so we can set a toolbar later and the layout
    width: 640 //Default width
    height: 480 //Default height
    color: "#f1f1f1" //Background Color

    RowLayout { //To organize the TextAreas side by side
        width: parent.width //Set the width to the same width ApplicationWindow
        height: parent.height //Set the height to the ApplicationWindow height

        TextArea { //A large text area for the markdown text
            id: mdarea //Unique identifier for this TextArea
            Layout.alignment: Qt.AlignCenter //Suggest to align center in the Layout
            Layout.preferredWidth: (parent.width / 2) - 5;   // Suggest the width to be half the size of the parent RowLayout then subtract 5px for a little spacing
            Layout.preferredHeight: parent.height - 10 //Suggest the height to be the size of the parent RowLayout then subtract 10px for spacing
            text: "Markdown Text Area" //Set default text
        }

        TextArea { //A large text area for the rich text/HTML
            id: rtarea
            Layout.alignment: Qt.AlignCenter
            Layout.preferredWidth: (parent.width / 2) - 5
            Layout.preferredHeight: parent.height - 10
            textFormat: TextEdit.RichText //this sets the text in this TextArea to show formatted text like HTML so it will show the HTML as if it were a webpage
            text: "Rich Text / HTML Text Area"
        }
    }

}
```

As you can see QML is a simple markup language that makes it very fast and easy to write UIs.  We create an ApplicationWindow as our base entity, and a RowLayout to organize its children.  2 TextAreas, one for Markdown, and another for the RichText/HTML.  _The reason I say RichText/HTML will be apparent later when we we make it so you can see it a formatted text or raw html._

In the comments above I say "Suggest".  I say this because when using _Layout.param_, this says that the child of the layout should follow this command as log as it does not cause the ParentLayout to break its defined parameters.

Now we need to set a parameter in the QML and in Go to set the text in each TextArea.  Fist we will remove the static text in mdarea.text, and rtarea.text with a variable names to reference in to Golang code.  When I say something like mdarea.text I mean:
    
    - We set the TextArea id in the Markdown text area as mdarea
    - And I use dot syntax to reference the text parameter
    
``` JavaScript
//assets/main.qml
...

    TextArea {
        id: mdarea
        ...
        text: mdtxt //A variable name to reference from the Golang code
    }
    TextArea {
        id: rtarea
        ...
        text: rttxt
    }
...
```

Now we can go to the Go code and create a context variable, which will be global so we access it from other parts of our code as needed. Then use the context to set vars before the window is created, to set the text on load.

``` Go
//main.qml

...
import {
    ...
}

var ctx qml.Context //Global var to set the qml context
...

func run() error {
    ...
    component, err := engine.LoadFile("assets/main.qml")
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
    //Above code we have already written I just wanted to give you a point of reference
    
    ctx = *engine.Context() //set the context with a pointer so the data stored stays persistent for the life of the variable. In this case the lifetime of the application
    ctx.SetVar("mdtxt", "Markdown Editor") //Set the "mdtxt" property inside the QML file to the provided string
    ctx.SetVar("rttxt", "Rich Text / HTML Editor")
    
    ...
}
...

```

The above Go code will now set the _mdtxt_ and _rttxt_ properties in the QML UI when the app loads.  Now we need to have a mechanism to parse and sync the markdown text area with the rich text text area.  We will do this in a couple steps.

 - First we will create a custom type from the Go code to import in to the QML
 - Then we will use a keyboard event in the _mdarea_ entity to listen for a change in the text
 - When the text changes in the _mdarea_ it will then send the _mdarea.text_ contents to the Go code to then parse the markdown and set the text in the rendered HTML in the _rtarea.text_ as RichText

First we create a global struct _HTMLText_ (_note: the fist letter is uppercase so the struct us exportable_), that takes a qml.Object, and a string

``` Go
//main.go

import {
    ...
}

type HTMLText struct {
    qml.Object
    Text string
}
...
```

Now we create a method _SetHTMLText_ (_again exportable_) to call from QML to manipulate the the data stored in _HTMLText_ and set the text in _rttext_ using the _ctx_ pointer.

```Go
//main.go

...
type HTMLText struct {
    ...
}

func (h *HTMLText) SetHTMLText(txt string) {
    //As you can see this is a method of HTMLText that uses a pointer that we will initialize after we write this code
    formattedTxt := blackfriday.MarkdownCommon([]byte(txt)) //blackfriday takes a byte array so we have to convert the txt string to a []byte
    h.Text = string(formattedTxt) //Since we want to string literal in the QML we convert the formatted text back to a string and set the h.Text
}
```

Now we need a way to create the HTMLText object in the QML file, for this we need to register types in QML from the Go code before the engine is initiated. 

``` Go
//main.go

...

func run() error {
    qml.RegisterTypes("TextConverter", 1, 0, []qml.TypeSpec{{
    // Above creates a importable type with an array of Type (qml.Objects) specifications
        Init: func (h *HTMLText, obj qml.Object) { // Initializes the object and creates a pointer for HTMLText that we can reference from QML in the method we just created
            h.Text = "Rich Text" //Sets default value... Could be anything
        },
    }})
    
    ...
}

...
```

See these 2 parts of the _Go-QML_ GoDoc: [qml.RegisterTypes](https://godoc.org/gopkg.in/qml.v1#RegisterTypes), and [qml.TypeSpec](https://godoc.org/gopkg.in/qml.v1#TypeSpec)

The above code is where things get complicated.  We created an importable set of object for QML.  We will do that now.

``` JavaScript
//assets/main.qml

import QtQuick 2.3
import QtQuick.Controls 1.4
import QtQuick.Layouts 1.0

import TextConverter 1.0 //The import name is the string from the first param in the qml.RegisterTypes then the number 1 is from the next param, then dot third param

ApplicationWindow {
    ...
    color: "#f1f1f1" // Old code for point of reference
    
    HTMLText { //Note the entity is the same name as the struct we created
        id: htmlText //Unique identifier
        text: "" //We create this to initialize the text param
        //Also note the lowercase text param I will explain below
    }
    
    ...
    
        TextArea {
            id: mdarea
            ...
            
            Keys.onReleased: { //While the mdarea is in focus and once you release after a key press we will call this function
                htmlText.setHTMLText(mdarea.text) //Here we run the method called in our Go code that will set the HTMLText.Text
                rtarea.text = htmlText.text //Here we call the htmlText by its Id and set rtarea's text param as the formatted text 
            }
        }
        
        ...
}


```

The GoDoc for Go-QML explains the lower casing: [Lowercasing_of_names](https://godoc.org/gopkg.in/qml.v1#hdr-Lowercasing_of_names)

In the above code you will see that I used [_Keys.onReleased_][rlsd], at first I did _onPressed_ but that sends the signal before the new character is added so _rtarea was always one character behind.


Now the app will auto sync and parse the markdown you write in _mdarea_ and format it to look nice in the _rtarea_.  But what if we wanted to see the HTML code.  Well what we will do next is make it so if we click into the _rtarea_ it will automatically show the raw HTML.


``` JavaScript
//assets/main.qml

...

    TextArea {
        id: rtarea
        ...
        
        onActiveFocusChange: { //Signal if you leave or enter the focus of rtarea
            if(!activeFocus) { //if you are not in the TextArea
                rtarea.textFormat = TextEdit.RichText //change the rtarea.textFormat to show the RichText, default
            } else { //if you are focused on the rtarea 
                rtarea.textFormat = TextEdit.PlainText //switch the textFormat to PlainText
                htmlText.setHTMLText(mdarea.text) //now we grab the mdarea.text and parse the markdown
                rtarea.text = htmlText.text //and set the newly parsed text to the rtarea.text
            }
        }
    }
    
...
```

You may ask why I took the extra 2 steps at the end of the else statement.  Well in QML once you set the _TextArea_ to show _RichText_, QML adds the _html_, _header_, and _body_ tags.  As well as it adds the font styling info as CSS which we do not want if we just want simple markdown HTML.  So once we set the _TextArea_ to _PlainText_ it will only show exactly what it is sent.

Now the final step will be to add a _Copy To HTML_ button, to easily extract the raw HTML. And paste it wherever.

``` JavaScript
//assets/main.qml

...

ApplicationWindow {
    ...
    
    toolBar: ToolBar { //Create a toolbar and set it as the ApplicationWindow's toolBar
    //This will create the space and auto adjust the other children of ApplicationWindow down
        RowLayout { //This formats the toolbar to move the buttons side by side
            width: parent.width
            height: prent.height
            
            Button {
                Layout.alignment: Qt.AlignRight //This tells QML that the button needs to be auto formatted to align right
                text: "Copy To HTML"
                
                onClicked: htmlText.copyToClip(mdarea.text) //We will create this method in the next part
        }
    }
    
    ...
}
```

The code above will now create a _ToolBar_ and add the _Copy To HTML_ _Button_, and call the curentlly non-existent method of _HTMLText.CopyToClip(string)_.  Let's build that now.

``` Go
//main.go

...

type HTMLText struct { //Already created, just a point of refrence
    ...
}

func (h *HTMLText) CopyToClip(txt string) { //A method of the HTMLText pointer that takes a raw markdown string
    formatted := blackfriday.MarkdownCommon([]byte(txt)) //We've seen this before
    _ = clipboard.WriteAll(string(formatted)) //Make sure you imported the clipboard lib and we convert the formatted []byte to a string
}

...
```

and that's it! While there are a lot of other things you can do with this, like sanitizing the markdown.  But now you can expiriment with stuff like saving an HTML file and so forth.

Good Luck!
